# SFML-procedural_terrain_generation
this is my first big project, i made a procedural terrain using sfml and a noisemap library https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite

made a chunk loading system, working on making it dynamiclly loading one
currently i have a player which is just a red dot that can move around the map using W,S,A,D
